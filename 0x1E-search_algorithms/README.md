# C - Search Algorithms 

In this project, I learned about the most basic search algorithms that exists for an array
the -Linear Search and the Binary Search, using the new found know how, i solved the problems listed below.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Linear search **
  * [0-linear.c](./0-linear.c): A C file that searches for
    values in an array using the Linear Search Algorithm.

* **1. Binary search **
  * [1-binary.c](./1-binary.c): A C file that searches for
    a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

* **2. Big O #0 **
  * [2-O](./2-O): A file that contains the time complexiy of problem 0

* **3. Big O #1  **
  * [3-O](./3-O): A file that contains the time complexity of problem 1

* **4. Big O #2 **
  * [4-O](./4-O)): A file that contains the worst case of a binary search of array size n

* **5. Big O #3 **
  * [5-O](./5-O): A file that contains the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n

* **6. Big O #4  **
  * [6-O](./6-O): A file that contains the the space complexity of the function / algorithm
